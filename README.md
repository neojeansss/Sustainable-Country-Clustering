This is my 4th Semester Machine Learning Final Project along with my partner, Matthew William Siregar. 

This project is a way to know which countries have used renewable energy. To determine the amount of clusters, we use K-Means to know how much are the optimal clusters. 
The dataset we used is from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anshtanwar/global-data-on-sustainable-energy
Along with the code, we also were tasked to make a paper out of the project as a final report, it is in the repository.
